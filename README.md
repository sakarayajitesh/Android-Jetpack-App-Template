# Android Jetpack App - Starter Template

Whenever we create a new Android project in Android Studio, it doesn't include the Jetpack components. We need to add each of the **manually**. So I have created a starter template app which includes navigation components :

1) Navigation
2) LiveData
3) ViewModel
4) Safeargs
5) Databinding

## How to use:
Just download the repository and use it to create your own app :)

**Thank you**
